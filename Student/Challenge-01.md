[Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge >](Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

In the year 2145, humanity had reached new heights in space exploration. The Quantum Seeker, a state-of-the-art spaceship, stood proudly on the launch pad at the Interstellar Spaceport. It was the culmination of decades of research, engineering, and dreams. Designed to explore the outer reaches of the Milky Way, it was equipped with the latest technology, including a revolutionary warp drive. The crew, a diverse team of scientists, engineers, and explorers, busily prepared for the journey ahead. The air was thick with anticipation and excitement; they were about to embark on a mission that would push the boundaries of human knowledge.

- Finally, you set up [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview/) on your repo which can run in your browser.

## Success Criteria

- Each member of your team has a github account, their own repo and codespace running on the repo.
