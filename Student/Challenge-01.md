# Challenge 01 - Setup Tools

[Home](../README.md) - [Next Challenge >](Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

DevOps is a broad concept that encompasses people, processes, and tools. The tools you use fall into a number of categories, including version control, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Infrastructure-as-Code, and security scanning. Within each category, you have many choices when it comes to implementation. In this challenge, you will set up your local machine and cloud environment with the minimum requirements, but the lessons that follow will translate to any DevOps practice, regardless of tooling. 

## Description

- Begin by creating a GitHub account that you can use for this hack. You may use an existing account if you have one already.

- Next, you will need to create a repository to store your future codebase.
  
- Finally, you will need some version of IDE or text editor to complete the challenges. We suggest using [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview/) which can run in your browser.


## Success Criteria

- Each member of your team has a github account, their own repo and codespace running on the repo.

## Learning Resources

- There are many other GUI-based Git clients aside from GitHub Desktop. Feel free to explore them [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). 
- If using VSCode as your editor, you can check [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github) to learn more about the built-in Git capabilities, and integration with GitHub. Feel free to use the VSCode Git features instead of the command line or GUI client.
