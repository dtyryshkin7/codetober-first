## Introduction

Historically, version control has been the first component that teams implement as they start on a project. It is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Version control systems allow developers to collaborate and simultaneously contribute to the same codebase. They can also help teams track versions (so code can be rolled back if bad changes are made) and track bugs, work, and testing by the team. Please take a moment to review the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to understand the basics of version control, focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

## Description

## Create a new GitHub Repo and Commit the Sample Application Files

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, lets get some code checked into source control. 

- Create a new branch in your repository.

- Finally, commit the files to your GitHub repository using your preferred Git client.

## Use an Existing GitHub Repo with the Sample Application Files


## Success Criteria

- Your repo is cloned to your local machine and sync'd with GitHub.com
- The `Application` and `ArmTemplates` folders are at the root of your repository

## Learning Resources

- Cloning a repository via the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)
- If working with the command line, check out these articles on [commiting](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits) and [pushing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) changes.
- Additionally, you may need to pull other people's changes into your local repository to stay in sync--see documentation for [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository) and [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github).

## Tips

- For a concise explanation of adding files to a repository via the command line, see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line). 
- To see how it's done in the GitHub portal, check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github).
