# Codetober #1 - The Awakening

## Introduction

First episode of Codetober is an engaging hands-on workshop designed to introduce you to collaborative coding and infrastructure management using Infrastructure as Code.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Collaborative Coding on GitHub:**
   - **Repository Setup:** Learn how to create and configure repositories on GitHub.
   - **Forking and Cloning:** Understand how to fork repositories and clone them to your local machine.
   - **Branching:** Explore the importance of branching and how to create and switch between branches.
   - **Pull Requests:** Master the process of making changes, committing them, and creating pull requests for collaborative review.
   - **Merging:** Learn how to review pull requests and merge them into the main branch.

2. **Terraform for Azure:**
   - **Introduction to Terraform:** Get an overview of Terraform and its benefits for infrastructure as code (IaC).
   - **Setting Up Terraform:** Install and configure Terraform on your local machine.
   - **Azure Integration:** Understand how to configure Terraform to work with Azure.
   - **Creating a Resource Group:** Learn how to write Terraform configurations to create and manage a resource group in Azure.
   - **Applying Changes:** Practice using Terraform commands to apply your configurations and provision resources in the cloud.


By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of collaborative coding workflows on GitHub, as well as practical experience in using Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure on Azure. You'll leave with the confidence to contribute to projects, manage code collaboratively, and automate cloud resource provisioning.
